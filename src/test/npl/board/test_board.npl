    /* ************ Task to complete *********************** */
    // The board has conveined and your task is to decided
    // if it should go for lunch. A ballot has been created
    // for that purpose.
    //
    // Your task is to
    //  - submit 4 votes to the ballot such that it gets
    //    accepted
    //  - count the votes & close the ballot
    //  - analyse the state machine and send Jean a
    //    screenshot thereof
    //
    // For those of you willing to go steps further, it is
    // encouraged to work as a team to define and augment
    // the board features with some (but not limited to)
    // of the following ideas:
    //  - ballot-specific quorum number
    //  - enforce the one-person one-vote equivalence
    //    (people can be represented by their name)
    //  - chairman casting the  decisive vote in case of
    //    tie-break
    //  - super-majority requirements for ballots labelled
    //    as 'budget-relevant'
    //  - any of your idea ;-)
    //
    // For all those features, test should also be implemented!
